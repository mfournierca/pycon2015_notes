what is rate tracking? 
    - how fast is someone doing something? 


how to build it? 
    - there's naive implementations


building it with redis
    - really fast reads and writes
    - suports structured data types
    - redis-py
    
keeping data in memory is a bit hard, they use a sharding cluster

they use "divided time", time buckets using unix timestamp








how would you do a probabilistic rate tracker?
