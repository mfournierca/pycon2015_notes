pandas basics

read data
    - many read functions, not just csv
    - sql, excel, stata, etc etc
    - unicode sandwich compliant

chardet
    - try to predict what encoding a string is in 

unidecode
    - don't do this unless you must
    - drop special characters
    

types are important!
    - 5 != '5'
    - 5 != 5.0


Merging on different types makes data disappear

convert types

be explicit

do conversion upfront, make data predictable

Kinds of nothing
    - no data, None
    - nullish "", 0


ids are not numbers

values
    - ordinal
    - category
    - numeric
    - etc


dealing with missing daata
    - replace, 
    - na_values option in pandas.read_*
    - .dropna
    - .dropna(how="all")
    - .fillna()
    - .interpolate() - wow!


Select multiple columns


indexing
    - logical operations, filters, etc, return list of indices


.value_counts()
    - count factors


.value_counts()
    - count factors


.replace()

.isin()


~ operator


.contains
    - can use regex

 
.pivot


.groupby


apply functionsto dataframe


merging datasets:
    - make sure types match
    - check sizes before and after
    - ditto for column counts
    - try with how=inner, how=outer


libraries
    - fuzzywuzzy
    - jellyfish


Graphs
    - ggplot
    - bokeh
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib
    - glue


pdfs suck
    - use tabula


Scaling Up:
    - don't let notebooks get in the way of reusable code
    - data pipelines, OKFN Bubbles, Storm, Spark, etc. 


Pattern
    - wrangle data
    - run calculations on _standardized_ data
    - ???
    - Profit!


Be conscious about what you load into memory
    

Blaze
    - pandas-like interface for querying large datasets


Takeaways
    - use proper types
    - data has a way of being used in unanticipated ways
    - documentation matters
    - fix data before you need it fixed!
        - fix it during collection if possible


Data cleaning is a necessary evil, but it is evil.
