Cluster roads by name origin (English, Indian, etc)

Need to classify street names by linguistic origin (machine learning)

Then cluster and map geo data.

NOTES

- geopandas lets you plot deo data very easily
- can use all the normal pandas operations. 


Classification needs:
- schema
- train / test labelled sets, supervised algorithm
- Numerical / bool features
- etc


Features: ngrams
- different languages have different combinations of letter
- useful for classification


Classifiers
- there's a cheatsheet in scikit learn for selecting a classifier
- training and using the classifier is as easy as caret


Choosing test metric:
- there are several, accuracy score is appropriate for classification
- classifier was 55% accurate


Improve the classifier
- more data
- more features
- hyperparameter tuning


Feature selection is most important, can add
- number of words
- average length of words
- are all the words in the dictionary
- what are the metadata tags? 


Pipelines
- important concept
- easy to tune and debug
- use transformer classes


HyperParamter tuning
- tuning the parameters of the classifier algorithm
- gridsearchcv
- gridsearchcv acts on the entire pipeline, not just the algorithm


Mapping:
- mplleaflet
- geopandas is great for mapping geo data
